# Hannah's Exploration of Digital Humanities 

Welcome to Hannah's github portfolio documenting digital humanities projects and reflections from Fall 2024. 

Just a quick background, I am an undergraduate student studying Biochemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. I was introduced to digital humanities through a class taught by Professor Whitney Trettien. To learn more about what I've learned this semester and how I've grown both as a student and a person, please feel free to read my reflections below.
