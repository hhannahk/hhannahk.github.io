# Reflection on the Collaborative Project in the Education Commons

The EC Critical Making project provided a unique opportunity for our group to explore the different fabrication processes available at the Education Commons, especially the laser cutter. Our goal was to utilize the fabrication technology to create a thoughtful visualization of The Umpire dataset. Although we were all familiar with the dataset through our previous multimedia essay project, there were decisions to make collaboratively as a group. What aspect of the dataset do we want to visualize? How do we most effectively visualize the dataset using fabrication technology? How do we add meaning and intentionality in our work? We aimed to create a meaningful relationship between the dataset and the audience interacting with our project. 

To accomplish this goal, our group first brainstormed ideas for the project. Since it was around the holiday season, we naturally gravitated towards festive themes. Starting with a Thanksgiving table, we progressed towards a more visual representation of a Christmas tree, with each ornament representing when the holiday was mentioned. Then, expanding on our theme of holidays, we decided to create a Community Tree, each layer representing the twelve months of the year. Each layer would have information on the type of holiday and the number of times it was mentioned during the respective month. We focused on the year 1916 since it was the first year Saint Patrick’s Day, a foreign holiday, was mentioned. The nuance of intercultural exchange within the Eastern State Penitentiary was intriguing to explore. We decided to use stickers of representative icons to encapsulate the number of occurrences a holiday was mentioned in a particular month in 1916. Afterwards, we chose our roles according to our personal preferences. Then we worked as a group to decide on a list of holidays to represent on our Community Tree: New Years, St. Patrick’s Day, Easter, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.
