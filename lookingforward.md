# Looking Forward: Future Plans and Aspirations

Some steps I hope to take to continue my exploration and studies of digital literacy. 

1) **Learn more markdown coding.** Markdown coding is not only applicable in website creation, but also in creating coding notebooks. I'm pursuing a minor in data science, and learning more markdown will help me effectively write coding notebooks. This is especially applicable in projects where comments and descriptions are crucial to create a comprehensive notebook that can be understood by not only myself, but other people.
   
2) **Explore various applications of 3D printing.** While talking with Noah at the Education Commons, I learned that 3D printing is used in medicinal field as well. I want to visit the 3D printing center at the Biotech Commons and learn more in depth about the fields the technology can be applied in. Hopefully, I will be able to work on an interesting passion project related to the application of 3D printing in medical or dental research.
   
3) **Attend more workshops.** I never realized Penn offers so many free workshops. I would like to take advantage of more of these workshops to learn a new skill or to take a break from studying by creating something interesting. I will keep an eye out for exciting classes coming up through the Common Press newsletter.
